install go (https://go.dev/doc/install)

Download source from releases, such as
dbxcli-3.0.0.zip
unzip
copy source in ~/go/src/github.com/dropbox/dbxcli
cd ~/go/src/github.com/dropbox/dbxcli

go build

you should have now in this folder a file named dbxli. Test if it works:

thomas ~/go/src/github.com/dropbox/dbxcli  $ ./dbxcli version  
dbxcli version: 0.1.0
SDK version: 5.4.0
Spec version: 097e9ba

Note: this runs a build fitting your current CPU architecture. If you run on Intel, you get Intel. If you are using AMD/Silicon, you get a build for Silicon.
While Intel can be used on Silicon thanks to Rosetta, it does not work the other way around.

To build on ARM an Intel version, useable on both architecture, instead of go build ente:
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dbxcli main.go          

Test as above.

Last step: 
Copy it into your destination folder, such as resources and sign it. (Modify the path below fitting to your path), also use your certificate name:

codesign --force --options runtime --sign "Developer ID Application: 4D Deutschland GmbH" /Users/thomas/Documents/4D/Komponenten/FileTransfer_Curl/optional/dbxcli_Mac_precompiled/dbxcli
